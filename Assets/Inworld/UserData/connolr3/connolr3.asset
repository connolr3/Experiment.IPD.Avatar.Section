      description: "The Museum Building in Trinity College Dublin. Conceived and
        erected between 1853 and 1857 by the Cork firm Dean and Woodward who also
        built the famous Oxford University Museum of Natural History, the building
        is one of the landmarks of Ruskinian Gothic architecture in Europe, as it
        is most remarkable for the abundant use of coloured stone in its interior
        and the breath-taking vista of the large central hall. The exterior and the
        capitals of columns inside exhibit exquisite ornamental carvings by the legendary
        master stonemasons John & James O\u2019Shea from Cork, while the internal
        columns and staircase are made from marble and polished limestones. The central
        hall further boasts of geological exhibits, with the skeletons of male and
        female Giant Irish Deer in the entrance lobby.\n\nThe museum building is
        also host to college students, mostly geology and geogrpahy stutends who
        learn and study here."
